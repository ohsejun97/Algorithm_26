## 1. Experimental Setup & Implementation

We implemented three search strategies within a FastAPI backend to observe their performance characteristics under load.

### A. Search Strategies
- **ID Lookup ($O(1)$):** Uses a pre-populated Python dictionary. Retrieval time is independent of the dataset size.
- **Name Search ($O(n)$):** Scans the list of 1,000 products once using a list comprehension.
- **Duplicate Detection ($O(n^2)$):** Employs nested loops to compare every product pair ($N \times N$) to identify duplicate names.

## 2. Performance Evaluation (Locust Load Test)

We simulated up to **50 concurrent users** using Locust to evaluate how the server handles stress across different complexities.

### B. Statistical Results

| Search Type | Complexity | Avg Response Time (ms) | Max Response Time (ms) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **ID Lookup** | $O(1)$ | **~1 ms** | **~5 ms** |
| **Name Search** | $O(n)$ | **~3 ms** | **~12 ms** |
| **Duplicate Search** | $O(n^2)$ | **~25 ms** | **~150+ ms** |

## 3. Analysis: Why $O(n^2)$ Degrades Under Load

The performance gap between $O(1)$ and $O(n^2)$ is not just mathematical but has significant real-world implications:

1.  **Quadratic Growth:** With 1,000 items, $O(n)$ performs 1,000 operations, while $O(n^2)$ performs **1,000,000 operations**. When 50 users request this simultaneously, the CPU must handle 50 million operations, leading to a bottleneck.
2.  **CPU Starvation:** $O(n^2)$ logic consumes nearly 100% of a CPU core during execution. Under high concurrency, requests are queued because the CPU cannot clear previous tasks fast enough, causing "Tail Latency" to skyrocket.
3.  **Real-World Impact:** As seen in Figure 6, while $O(1)$ and $O(n)$ remain stable, the $O(n^2)$ response time (yellow/green lines) spikes as user count grows, eventually leading to timeouts and a degraded user experience.

## 4. Conclusion

The results empirically prove that $O(n^2)$ algorithms are the primary cause of system instability in high-traffic environments. To optimize, a **Hash-based approach** (using a set for duplicate checking) should be used to reduce the complexity to $O(n)$, ensuring system reliability even under extreme load.
